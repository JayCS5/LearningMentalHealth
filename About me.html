      I'm a 16 year old high school student in my senior year.
      I'm located in Belize City, Belize, and I decided to create
      this website in order to promote and educate about mental health
      especially for those in developing countries. Mental health involves
      one's social, psychological and emotional well-being. Society often portrays
      sharing our emotions and feelings as weak; however, I am of the opinion
      that it is the opposite. I think that having the bravery to express what you feel
      is one of the best and bravest things you can do for yourself. It's ok to not be okay
      and it's ok to need help. We all deserve happiness.
       Thoughts like these influenced my mission statement which is "Achieving happiness one breath at a time".
